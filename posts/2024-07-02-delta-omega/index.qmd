I have been inducted into the [Delta Omega Honory Society in Public
Health](https://deltaomega.org/) as an Alumni Member.

The Delta Omega Honorary Society in Public Health was founded in 1924 at Johns
Hopkins University within the School of Hygiene and Public Health to promote the
graduate study of public health, and to recognize outstanding achievement in the
new field.

Members are inducted by chapters through a highly-selective process that
assesses their outstanding performance and devotion to the field. To maintain
the credibility of this prestigious society, chapters are limited in the number
of members they may induct each year.

I was inducted into Delta Omega during the 2024 ColoradoSPH Alumni Awards on 22 May
2024, and officially reconzied by the national organization on 2 July 2024.
