I have successfully defended my Ph.D. dissertation: ["Parsimonious B-Spline
Regression Models via Control Polygon and Control Net Reduction for Identifying
Factors Explaining Variation in Daily Hormone Profiles During The Menopausal
Transition."](https://doi.org/10.25677/awnc-b795)

Only minor edits to make to the dissertation itself.  Several publications are
forthcoming.  You can get more info on the control polygon and control net
reduction methods from the R package cpr available on
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=cpr" target="_blank"> CRAN </a>,
